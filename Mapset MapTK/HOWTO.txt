Add maps to MapTK.prj

 - In map TK, Create Overview map (./nemrod.mp is created)
 - Open ./nemrod.mp in GPSMapEdit and in File>Map Properties, give it a significant name (ie: Nemrod Maps)
 - Change the level 0 in the overview map to match level 0 in maps it was created from.
 - DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE
 - In map TK Compile it to img, from map tk(./nemrod.mp compiles to ./nemrod.img)
 - In map TK, Make
OR
 - In map TK, Create Overview map (./nemrod.mp is created)
 - In map TK, run the script (click script button) on the ./nemrod.mp file
 - In map TK, run MAKE


After that, you can open the generated overview map file and remove the file paths from the individual maps. For each maps
represented in the overview, Maptk puts the full path as its name. Search and replace in the .img file and it works.

 
Update installer if needed (new maps, new registry keys in .reg file generated on the make)
